        Initializes the high-precision timer.

        Parameters
        ----------
        interval_s : float
            The desired time interval between triggers, in seconds.
        c_trigger_func : ctypes function object or similar
            The C-level trigger function to call. This should be a function
            pointer from a loaded library, e.g., `mvsdk._sdk.CameraSoftTrigger`.
            The expected signature is `void(int)`.
        hCamera : int
            The integer handle to the camera, which will be passed to the
            trigger function.
        busy_wait_us : int, optional
            The duration in microseconds (µs) for the final busy-wait loop.
            This determines the trade-off between CPU usage and timing precision.
            It should be slightly longer than the system's timer resolution
            (which is set to 1ms by this timer). A value of 2000 (2ms) is a
            good starting point. Default is 2000.
        priority : int, optional
            The priority of the internal timer thread.
            - 0: Normal (default)
            - 1: Above Normal
            - 2: Highest
            - 3: Time Critical (use with caution, can affect system stability)
